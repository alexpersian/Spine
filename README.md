# Spine
Emotional Engagement for Audiobooks

Spine is a project for the [Audible Future of Listening](http://thefutureoflisteninghackathon.bemyapp.com) hackathon. Its goal is to increase reader engagement with material by allowing them to react to parts of the book through emoji. When the next users are listening to those very important parts they will be softly alerted.
